# Utilitas.jl
Some nifty Julia methods for package management. Taken from the Latin of the word "Utility".

**Note**: _If you find a bug, or want a new feature, consider opening an issue for that_.

### Currently implemented methods
```
- search():  Searches and returns the information of the selected package

- seadd():  Searches and adds the selected package into the current environment

- gelat(x::String):  Get the latest version of a package. Leaving the parameters empty will initiate a fuzzy search

- chkall():  Check if all the installed packages are at the latest version or not

- chklat(x::String):  Compare the latest version of a package to the current version
```
